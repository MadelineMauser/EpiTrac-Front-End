        Clinical epilepsy drug trials have been measuring increasingly high placebo
        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)

        Rico, the first records of the transmission of Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika
        (ZIKV) viruses were confirmed in May 2014 and December 2015, respectively.
        Transmission of CHIKV peaked in September 2014, whereas that of ZIKV peaked
        in August 2016. The emergence of these mosquito-transmitted arboviruses in
        the context of a lack of human population immunity allowed observations of
        whether the outbreaks were associated with Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)
        densities and weather. Mosquito density was monitored weekly in four communities
        using sentinel autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) during 2016 in order
        to provide data to be compared with the findings of a previous study carried
        out during the 2014 CHIKV epidemic. Findings in two communities protected
        against Ae. aegypti using mass AGO trapping (three traps per house in most
        houses) were compared with those in two nearby communities without vector
        control. Mosquito pools were collected to detect viral RNA of ZIKV, CHIKV
        and dengue virus. In areas without vector control, mosquito densities and
        rates of ZIKV detection in 2016 were significantly higher, similarly to those
        observed for CHIKV in 2014. The density of Ae. aegypti in treated sites was
        less than two females/trap/week, which is similar to the putative adult female
        threshold for CHIKV transmission. No significant differences in mosquito density
        or infection rates with ZIKV and CHIKV at the same sites between years were
        observed. Although 2016 was significantly wetter, mosquito densities were
        similar.","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30225842","doi":"10.1111/mve.12338"}}]}'
