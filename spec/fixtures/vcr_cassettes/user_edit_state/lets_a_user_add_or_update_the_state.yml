        Clinical epilepsy drug trials have been measuring increasingly high placebo
        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)
        and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS: The RR50 results showed evidence
        that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets.
        The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two.
        CONCLUSIONS: Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the
        natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore,

        Transmission of CHIKV peaked in September 2014, whereas that of ZIKV peaked

        virus (DENV) are closely related flaviviruses that cause widespread, acute
        febrile illnesses, notably microcephaly for fetuses of infected pregnant women.
        Detecting the viral cause of these illnesses is paramount to determine risks
        to patients, counsel pregnant women, and help fight outbreaks. A combined
        diagnostic algorithm for ZIKV and DENV requires Reverse transcription polymerase
        chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM antibody detection. RT-PCR differentiates
        between DENV and ZIKV infections during the acute phases of infection, but
        differentiation based on IgM antibodies is currently nearly impossible in
        endemic areas. We have developed a ZIKV/DENV protein array and tested it with
        serum samples collected from ZIKV- and DENV-infected patients and healthy
        subjects in Puerto Rico. Our analyses reveal a biomarker panel that are capable
        of discriminating ZIKV and DENV infections with high accuracy, including Capsid
        protein from African ZIKV strain MR766, and other 5 pair of proteins (NS1,
        NS2A, NS3, NS4B and NS5) from ZIKV and DENV respectively. Both sensitivity
        and specificity of the test for ZIKV from DENV are around 90%. We propose
        that the ZIKV/DENV protein array will be used in future studies to discriminate
        patients infected with ZIKV from DENV.","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141913","doi":"10.1074/mcp.RA117.000310"}}]}'
