        immunoassay is a point-of-care assay that was under investigational use for
        detecting Bacillus anthracis capsular polypeptide (polyglutamic acid) in human
        blood, serum, and plasma. Small sample volumes, rapid results, and no refrigeration
        required allow for easy use in either the field or laboratory. Although the
        test was developed for use in suspect cases of human inhalation anthrax, its
        features also make it a potentially powerful tool for testing suspect animal
        cases. We tested animal tissue samples that were confirmed or ruled out for
        B. anthracis. The AAD Rapid Tests were also deployed in the field, testing
        animal carcasses during an anthrax outbreak in hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius)
        and Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in Namibia. Evaluation of all samples showed
        a specificity of 82% and sensitivity of 98%. However, when the assay was used
        on specimens from only fresh carcasses (dead for less than 24 hours), the
        specificity increased to 96%. The AAD Rapid Test is a rapid and simple screening
        assay, but confirmatory testing needs to be done, especially when the age
        of the sample (days animal has been deceased) is unknown. This article is
