        immunoassay is a point-of-care assay that was under investigational use for
        detecting Bacillus anthracis capsular polypeptide (polyglutamic acid) in human
        blood, serum, and plasma. Small sample volumes, rapid results, and no refrigeration
        required allow for easy use in either the field or laboratory. Although the
        test was developed for use in suspect cases of human inhalation anthrax, its
        features also make it a potentially powerful tool for testing suspect animal
        cases. We tested animal tissue samples that were confirmed or ruled out for
        B. anthracis. The AAD Rapid Tests were also deployed in the field, testing
        animal carcasses during an anthrax outbreak in hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius)
        and Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in Namibia. Evaluation of all samples showed
        a specificity of 82% and sensitivity of 98%. However, when the assay was used
        on specimens from only fresh carcasses (dead for less than 24 hours), the
        specificity increased to 96%. The AAD Rapid Test is a rapid and simple screening
        assay, but confirmatory testing needs to be done, especially when the age
        of the sample (days animal has been deceased) is unknown. This article is

        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)
        and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS: The RR50 results showed evidence
        that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets.
        The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two.
        CONCLUSIONS: Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the
        natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore,
        the placebo response in epilepsy clinical trials may be attributable almost
        entirely to this variability, rather than the \"placebo effect\".","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102709","doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2017.10.016"}},{"id":"42","type":"article","attributes":{"article_id":"5","author":"Goldenholz,

        Clinical epilepsy drug trials have been measuring increasingly high placebo

        immunoassay is a point-of-care assay that was under investigational use for
        detecting Bacillus anthracis capsular polypeptide (polyglutamic acid) in human
        blood, serum, and plasma. Small sample volumes, rapid results, and no refrigeration
        required allow for easy use in either the field or laboratory. Although the
        test was developed for use in suspect cases of human inhalation anthrax, its
        features also make it a potentially powerful tool for testing suspect animal
        cases. We tested animal tissue samples that were confirmed or ruled out for
        B. anthracis. The AAD Rapid Tests were also deployed in the field, testing
        animal carcasses during an anthrax outbreak in hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius)
        and Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in Namibia. Evaluation of all samples showed
        a specificity of 82% and sensitivity of 98%. However, when the assay was used
        on specimens from only fresh carcasses (dead for less than 24 hours), the
        specificity increased to 96%. The AAD Rapid Test is a rapid and simple screening
        assay, but confirmatory testing needs to be done, especially when the age
        of the sample (days animal has been deceased) is unknown. This article is

        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)
        and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS: The RR50 results showed evidence
        that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets.
        The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two.
        CONCLUSIONS: Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the
        natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore,
        the placebo response in epilepsy clinical trials may be attributable almost
        entirely to this variability, rather than the \"placebo effect\".","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102709","doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2017.10.016"}},{"id":"38","type":"article","attributes":{"article_id":"5","author":"Goldenholz,

        Clinical epilepsy drug trials have been measuring increasingly high placebo
        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)
        and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS: The RR50 results showed evidence
        that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets.
        The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two.
        CONCLUSIONS: Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the
        natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore,
        the placebo response in epilepsy clinical trials may be attributable almost
        entirely to this variability, rather than the \"placebo effect\".","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102709","doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2017.10.016"}},{"id":"52","type":"article","attributes":{"article_id":"5","author":"Goldenholz,
