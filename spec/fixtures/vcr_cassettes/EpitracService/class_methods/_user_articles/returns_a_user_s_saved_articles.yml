        Clinical epilepsy drug trials have been measuring increasingly high placebo
        response rates, up to 40%. This study was designed to examine the relationship
        between the natural variability in epilepsy, and the placebo response seen
        in trials. We tested the hypothesis that ''reversing'' trial direction, with
        the baseline period as the treatment observation phase, would reveal effects
        of natural variability. METHOD: Clinical trial simulations were run with time
        running forward and in reverse. Data sources were: SeizureTracker.com (patient
        reported diaries), a randomized sham-controlled TMS trial, and chronically
        implanted intracranial EEG electrodes. Outcomes were 50%-responder rates (RR50)
        and median percentage change (MPC). RESULTS: The RR50 results showed evidence
        that temporal reversal does not prevent large responder rates across datasets.
        The MPC results negative in the TMS dataset, and positive in the other two.
        CONCLUSIONS: Typical RR50s of clinical trials can be reproduced using the
        natural variability of epilepsy as a substrate across multiple datasets. Therefore,
        the placebo response in epilepsy clinical trials may be attributable almost
        entirely to this variability, rather than the \"placebo effect\".","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102709","doi":"10.1016/j.seizure.2017.10.016"}},{"id":"132","type":"article","attributes":{"article_id":"6","author":"Hall,
